## Running the Online Voting System Locally

### Preparing Files

1. Download [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) into your system if you have not already.
2. Download [this repository](https://github.com/13250432/SE_OVS2) as zip (or clone this repository using git). Unzip if needed.
3. Put ``server.env`` into the same directory as ``server.js`` (which should be this project's root directory).

### Starting the Server

4. Open a terminal instance and ``cd`` into the same directory as ``server.js``.
5. run this command: ``npm install``. This ensures the dependencies are set up correctly.
6. run this command: ``npm start``. This will start the server.
7. Note down the port outputted to the terminal. By default it is ``8099``.
8. Enter ``localhost:<port>`` in your browser to access the Online Voting System. You can quickly access through [here](http://localhost:8099).
